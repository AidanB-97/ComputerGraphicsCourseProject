# ComputerGraphicsCourseProject
Aidan: Made the scene/game and textures for walls, floor, and obstacles. -I specified in the code what is mine and what I got from Youtube tutorials, google searches, etc...
The code I took from online was to get the game to be playable as I do not have any experience with programming movement, first person cameras, etc... in a 3D project.
Shuaiyan: Made all the shaders
